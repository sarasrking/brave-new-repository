## Description

It is also the document for displaying some examples of **markdown**. For example:

- This is a list
- You create a list by adding a dash and a space before the items
- So it makes things clearer for the reader

It is also possible to create checklists - see this for an example: 

- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request

It is a convention to use '@' to tag people:

@github/ragamouf
